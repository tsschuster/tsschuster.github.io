<h4>The complexity of many-body quantum dynamics <br></h4>
<p>The past decade has seen a revolution in our knowledge of the dynamics of information in quantum systems, with wide-ranging implications for quantum chaos, quantum communication, thermodynamics, and quantum gravity.

A remarkable finding from quantum gravity is that one can utilize information scrambling to enable intrinsically many-body generalizations of quantum teleportation. In a recent work, We introduced a new mechanism for many-body teleportation that encompasses and generalizes all previous instances of teleportation outside of “gravitational” systems. Our work establishes a new generic mechanism for scrambling-assisted quantum communication, and paves the way to using many-body teleportation as an experimental litmus test for gravitational dynamics.
In two collaborations with trapped ion [Nature 567 61-65 (2019)] and superconducting [Phys. Rev. X 11.2 021010 (2021)] experiments, we demonstrated a surprising application of many-body teleportation: that teleportation can serve as a robust measurement of information scrambling in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence.

<h4>Random unitaries <br></h4>
<p>What is the classical com- plexity of simulating quantum dynamics? Existing rigorous results for a quantum advantage are largely limited to noise-free dynamics and sampling tasks that are not of direct physical relevance. Meanwhile, recent numerical works suggest a somewhat counterintuitive propo- sition: despite the exponential dimensionality of Hilbert space, many properties of noisy quantum dynamics are in fact efficiently simulable in the system size. I am interested in pushing towards rigorous statements on the classical simulability of noisy quantum systems and local physical observables, by combining insights from quantum dynamics, tensor net- works, and quantum information theory.

In recent theoretical work [forthcoming (2022)], we substantially refine this understanding by providing a universal framework for the effect of local noise on information dynamics. We show that noisy quantum systems display universal classes of information dynamics that fundamentally differ from their unitary counterparts.</p>  

<h4>Quantum metrology and quantum learning <br></h4>
<p>The goal of any experiment is to learn properties of a system from measurements on it. The existence of non-classical features such as quantum entanglement suggests that learning about quantum systems might pose challenges not present with their classical counterparts.
We provide a novel route to address this by introducing out-of-time-order (OTO) measurements as a resource for quantum learning. We also rigorously establish that there are properties of quantum systems that are efficiently learnable with OTO measurements, but which require exponentially many operations in the system size for any time-ordered measurement strategy.

<h4>Topological codes and out-of-equilibrium topological phenomena <br></h4>
<p>The bulk-boundary correspondence is hallmark feature of topological phases. A series of recent works have established that for non-invertible topological order, this correspondence takes the form of emergent symmetries in the boundary theory. In recent work, we introduce a systematic framework for characterizing the boundary Hilbert space of topological stabilizer codes. In particular, our framework allows us to extend results on the bulk- boundary correspondence in conventional topological orders to fracton topological orders in 3D. We show that bulk fractonic order leads to emergent subsystem and fractal symmetries on the boundary theory, whose properties are inherited from the statistics and mobility of bulk quasiparticles and which can be naturally characterized using algebraic techniques.</p> 

<h4>Out-of-equilibrium topological phenomena <br></h4>
<p>Atomic, molecular, and optical platforms provide an entirely new physical context for the realization of topological phases. These platforms allow unheralded microscopic dynamical control, but also hold new restrictions, as high-energy noise processes prevent easy access to ground-state physics. I am interested in the existence and robustness of topological phenomena in such out-of- equilibrium settings.
In work prior to graduate school, we predicted that an analogue of non-Abelian statistics can occur in topological zero modes of non-interacting photonic systems. We recently collaborated to experimentally realize this prediction.

We introduced an example, the “Floquet Hopf insulator”, where this is not the case [Phys. Rev. Letters 123 266803 (2019)]: the static Hopf insulator is classified by an integer invariant, while the Floquet Hopf insulator has a Z × Z2 classification. This contrast leads to a measurable physical consequence, namely, an unusual bulk-boundary correspondence where gapless edge modes are topologically protected, but may exist at either 0- or pi-quasienergy.
